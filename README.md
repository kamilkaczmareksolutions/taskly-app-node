# Taskly App Node

## Quality automation

Pull requests run typecheck and coverage in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml). A separate workflow can add unit tests for the diff. See [SOLUTION.md](SOLUTION.md).

## Setup

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

## Docker

```sh
docker compose up --build -d --wait
```

Application: http://localhost:8080. API: http://localhost:8000/docs.

```sh
docker compose down
```

## Frontend

React + TypeScript + Vite. Tests: Vitest + React Testing Library.

Installation:

```sh
cd frontend
npm ci
```

Development — http://localhost:5173:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Storybook — http://localhost:6006:

```sh
npm run storybook
```

Tests:

```sh
npm test
```

Coverage — `frontend/coverage/index.html`:

```sh
npm run test:coverage
```

## Backend

Node.js + TypeScript + Express. Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM. Tests: Vitest + Supertest.

Requires Node.js >=22.12 and PostgreSQL.

Installation:

```sh
cd backend
npm ci
```

Database — run from the repository root:

```sh
docker compose up -d --wait postgres
```

Development — http://localhost:8000/docs (from `backend`):

```sh
npm run dev
```

Production:

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

### Database (Prisma ORM)

Schema — `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`. Connection — root `.env`.

Validate schema:

```sh
npm run db:validate
```

Generate client — also runs during installation and build:

```sh
npm run db:generate
```

Database browser:

```sh
npm run db:studio
```

Schema migrations are managed separately; generating the client does not update the database.

### Tests and coverage

Type check:

```sh
npm run typecheck
```

Tests:

```sh
npm test
```

Watch mode:

```sh
npm run test:watch
```

Coverage — `backend/coverage/index.html`:

```sh
npm run test:coverage
```
